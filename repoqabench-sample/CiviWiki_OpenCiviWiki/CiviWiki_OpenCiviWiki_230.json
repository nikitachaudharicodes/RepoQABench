Further it makes little sense to have to look out for a mouse pointer to know which window is going to scroll up or down when one presses the arrow key. May I suggest having one active element at a time, highlighting the active element's borders, and providing keyboard shortcuts to switch between them, as well as customised scroll bars. ",
