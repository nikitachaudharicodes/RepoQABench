Thanks!\n\n@seanlip ok\r\n\n\nHi @mjprince, Any updates on this issue ? \r\n\r\nOr are you stuck anywhere ? Let us know, we'll be happy to help you out :).\n\nHi @bansalnitish.\r\nI have made a pull request on this issue, https://github.com/oppia/oppia/pull/6116\r\nAll my changes are clearly mentioned on that PR.\r\n\r\nAnd this pull request has been merged already.\r\nHowever, I am open to learning, so if there is anything I could do better, kindly mention it on the pull request.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\n\nHi @mjprince, Oh great! Thanks for the same. Just don't forget to follow the checklist in the PR. Ideally, you should add Fixes #bugnum in the PR description. This would automatically close the issue once the PR is merged :).\r\n\r\nCould you take up an issue from the `To-do` list -- https://github.com/oppia/oppia/projects/27? These are user-facing bugs (and high-priority ones!) and we need to bring down the count of these. I think you could help us out here. Let me know if you want to work on any of these, I'll assign you one. \r\n\r\nThanks!\n\nClosing this one. This is fixed via PR #6116.\n\nHi Bansal,\n\nI would like to work on any of the following two issues:\n\n- https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues/6325\n- https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues/6285\n\nHowever, if there are any high priority issues which you would like me to\nwork on, please let me know.\n\nRegards,\n\nLe ven. 22 févr. 2019 à 15:09, Nitish Bansal <notifications@github.com> a\nécrit :\n\n> Closed #4231 <https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues/4231>.\n>\n> —\n> You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues/4231#event-2157940509>, or mute\n> the thread\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ArbZkRmt4jqqQt6TWM2yHUSfEqi5VsM6ks5vP_oMgaJpZM4RFUgj>\n> .\n>\n\n\nHi @mjprince, \r\n\r\nAre you working on any issue?

    "Hi @unit-00, thanks for the detailed writeup! \r\n\r\nOne thought for a path to investigate: does this happen with a plain vanilla app that uses just the standard bootstrap modal (or maybe the standard angular-bootstrap modal)? I think a good way to figure out what's going on might be: create a vanilla implementation of the modal that works correctly, then try to narrow down the difference between the two modals (e.g. try to make the implementation of the vanilla modal more similar to the oppia one) until the vanilla modal breaks. That should give some insight into what's causing the issue. What do you think?",
    "Hi @seanlip ,\r\n\r\nI think that's actually a great idea. I tried to rebuild the modal with a similar css in codepen, but I wasn't sure which js is running in the background thus I didn't rebuild it properly.\r\n\r\nHow do I go about building a plain vanilla app with the standard angular-bootstrap modal with the proper js?\r\n\r\nPS. If anyone else wants to solve this issue, please feel welcome. I am trying my best, but the quicker we can solve this, the better it would be.",
    "Hey @vibhor98 ,\r\n\r\nI'll try to reimplement it again!\r\n\r\nQuick follow up question, when changing the options, is the `rule_editor` being called upon?",

    "Hi @unit-00,  please look at this example of [bootstrap modal](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/modal/#scrolling-long-content). Here bootstrap with JS example is given referring which you can implement vanilla app without using AngularJS and later on, if it works you can extent your work with Angular as well. Let me know if you've any doubt.",
