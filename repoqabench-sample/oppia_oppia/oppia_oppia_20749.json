  "issue_description": "# [BUG]: Next Chapter Button Overlapped by Footer on Mobile Viewport.\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nIn the mobile viewport, specifically mimicking an iPhone 6, the \"Next Chapter\" button on the last state of the exploration is not visible as it is overlapped by the footer. It is also affecting our acceptance tests which are set to run on this specific viewport.\n\n### URL of the page where the issue is observed.\n\nNA\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\ni) Set the viewport to mimic an iPhone 6 (375x667) using Puppeteer or a similar tool.\r\nii) Navigate to an exploration present as chapter in a story and progress to the last state.\r\niii) Observe that the \"Next Chapter\" button is not visible. (Make sure there are more than chapters)\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe \"Next Lesson\" button should be clearly visible and accessible to the user, regardless of the viewport size. The button should not be overlapped by the footer or any other elements on the page.\n\n### Screenshots/Videos\n\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3607bad-c081-45a5-9fde-cf1d43a688d0\r\n\r\n\n\n### What device are you using?\n\nDesktop\n\n### Operating System\n\nMacOS\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Browser version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Tips for developers\n\nBefore addressing the bug, please identify which PR caused the issue (you can follow the steps [here](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/How-to-find-the-commit-which-introduced-a-bug)).

    "Hi @Akhilesh-max , I have a fix for this but can't figure out how to verify it. In particular I can't see any explorations when I run dev server. I have tried creating my own exploration but can't create different chapters. Could you help me out with this? I found the fix by looking at chrome dev tools elements tab, it should be some minor changes to `conversation-skin-next-lesson-wrapper` class' style in `conversation-skin.component.css` (haven't verified fully of course)\r\n\r\n**Edit**: I added a collection from the admin page, and I could test my changes using that.\r\nHere is what it looks like now, but I am not sure what the intended look is, let me know if this is correct:\r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"342\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6e09292-e81d-4e3f-95f5-7ccdefcdbc56\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy proposed changes are the following in `conversation-skin.component.css`:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"333\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37ee0159-485c-46ce-ad4a-1854d22789b2\">",

    "Hi @Sidla this looks great! Great job on demonstrating your changes, just make sure these changes are not making the desktop site behave unexpectedly. Assigning you the issue so you can make a PR for it. Make sure you follow [the rules for making a PR](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Rules-for-making-PRs) from the wiki. Thanks!\r\n\r\nP.S. You don't need to upload your implementation video on YouTube to share it, you can directly drag it from wherever it is saved on your pc to the github comment textbox. Github will take care of storing your video for you."

    "How does the current CSS positioning contribute to the 'Next Chapter' button being overlapped by the footer on mobile viewports?",

  "golden_answers_generated": [
    "The CSS for the 'conversation-skin-correctness-footer-container' positions the footer as fixed at the bottom of the viewport with a bottom offset of 40px. This can cause it to overlap other elements, such as the 'Next Chapter' button, especially in smaller viewports like that of an iPhone 6. The button's container, 'conversation-skin-next-lesson-wrapper', also has relative positioning which might not prevent overlap with the fixed footer.",
    "Developers can follow the steps outlined in the Oppia repository wiki for finding the commit that introduced a bug. This typically involves using Git's bisect feature to efficiently pinpoint the exact commit where the issue first appeared by testing various commits in a binary search fashion.",
    "To ensure the 'Next Chapter' button is visible, the CSS can be adjusted by either changing the 'conversation-skin-correctness-footer-container' to have a larger bottom offset or adjusting the 'conversation-skin-next-lesson-wrapper' so that it has a higher z-index or margins that prevent overlap. Another approach could be to use media queries to adjust the layout specifically for small screen sizes.",
    "Viewport emulation settings in Puppeteer, such as setting the viewport to mimic an iPhone 6 (375x667), will replicate the screen size and resolution of such a device. This ensures that the UI is tested under conditions similar to real-world usage on such devices, allowing detection of layout issues like the overlapping button, which might not be apparent in larger desktop viewports.",
    "A developer can ensure that they have correctly set up the development environment according to the Oppia wiki guidelines. They should verify that the required data is seeded, ensure no errors occur during server startup, and check the browser console for any JavaScript errors. Additionally, they might need to create or configure explorations correctly to simulate a multi-chapter scenario to reproduce the bug."
