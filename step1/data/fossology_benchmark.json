Create a tag with any name, e.g., `TestTag`\n2. Try creating the same tag again with the same name\n3. Observe that the function does **not** insert a duplicate but still shows a success message\n\n## Expected Behavior\n- If a tag with the same name already exists, the function should return `\"Tag already exists.\"`\n\n## Actual Behavior\n- The function does **not** insert the tag (correct behavior)  \n- **Incorrectly returns a success message** instead of reporting the duplicate\n\n## Suggested Fix\nModify `CreateTag()` to properly check for existing tags and return the correct error message before attempting insertion.\n\n### Potential Fix Code:\n```php\n$sql = \"SELECT 1 FROM tag WHERE tag = '\" . pg_escape_string($tag_name) . \"' LIMIT 1;\";\n$result = pg_query($PG_CONN, $sql);\nif (pg_num_rows($result) > 0) {\n    pg_free_result($result);\n    return _(\"Tag already exists.\");\n}\n\n\n",

This can lead to users mistakenly moving content into the same folder or an unintended location.\n\n## Current Behavior\n- The sidebar lists the folder structure but does not highlight the currently selected folder.\n- The selection box shows folders for moving content but does not indicate the parent folder of the selected item.\n- Users can unintentionally move items into the same folder without any warning.\n\n## Expected Behavior\n- The sidebar should highlight the currently selected folder to provide better navigation.\n- The selection box should indicate the parent folder of the selected item.\n- A warning or restriction should be added to prevent moving content into the same folder.\n\n\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a829c08-727e-4050-8bbe-cce0bb60e7cc)\n\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n1. Open the move folder feature.\n2. Select a folder inside another folder from the selection box.\n3. Notice that there is no clear indication of the parent folder.\n4. Attempt to move content and observe that it can be moved into the same folder without warning.\n\n## Suggested Fix\n- Highlight the currently selected folder in the sidebar.\n- Display the parent folder in the selection box.\n- Add a validation check to prevent moving a folder into itself.\n\nThis enhancement will improve usability and prevent unintentional errors.\n",

Here\u2019s a summary of the steps I've taken so far:\r\n\r\nInitial Logging in src/scanoss/agent/snippet_scan.c and src/scanoss/agent/main.c: I added detailed logs to verify that scanning is completed properly.  both snippet_scan.c and main.c appear to perform scanning as expected, indicating these components are functioning correctly.\r\n\r\nI next verified whether agent_scanoss was correctly adding jobs to the jobqueue in database. However, as shown in the second image, the jobqueue table doesnot have proper data.\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aba1501d-d54e-40e9-a665-1391471e3f67)\r\n\r\nAfter further investigation, I found that the AgentAdd function was missing in src/scanoss/ui/agent-scanoss.php. This function is essential as it calls doAgentAdd, which is responsible for adding scan information to the job queue table. I went ahead and implemented the missing AgentAdd function to call doAgentAdd as required.\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7668b44c-9580-4e4b-bd83-d605f109165b)\r\n\r\nDespite adding the AgentAdd function, the issue persists.\r\n\r\n@shaheemazmalmmd  Could you please advise if there might be additional steps or specific configurations I'm missing that could resolve this issue?\r\n"
