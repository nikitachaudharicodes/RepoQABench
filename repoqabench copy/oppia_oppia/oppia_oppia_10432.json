  "issue_description": "# Load dummy new structures data on activities tab for admins isn't working. \n\n**Describe the bug**\r\nI checked out develop and then merged with the updated upstream. I logged on as an admin, gave myself admin privileges and then tried to load the 'Load dummy new structures data' on the activities tab of the admin page. I got a 'Sever error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'version'' error. This was working a week ago. There seems to be a problem with getting the version in base_models delete_multi.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n 1. Run the dev server.\r\n 2. Sign on as an admin.\r\n 3. Go to the admin page and give yourself admin rights.\r\n 4. Go to the activities tab of the admin page and click load data for the 'Load dummy new structures data' section.\r\n 5. See error.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nYou can see the error on the bottom right of the ui:\r\n<img width=\"1734\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-08-24 at 3 58 28 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19376937/91105057-f3fe6200-e623-11ea-97da-6537c4ff6bb8.png\">\r\n\r\nTerminal output:\r\n<img width=\"1252\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-08-24 at 3 58 49 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19376937/91105019-e1842880-e623-11ea-9968-e6aa7043801b.png\">\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information; delete this section if the issue does not arise on desktop):**\r\n - OS: [Catalina, 10.15.16]\r\n - Browser [Chrome]\r\n - Version [84]",
