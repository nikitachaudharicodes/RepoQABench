  "issue_description": "# [BUG]: Overlapping Text Blocks Input in Exploration Creator on Mobile Width\n\n### Describe the bug\n\n In the Exploration Creator on the creator dashboard, while using a mobile width, the text ‘Oppia, tell learner to’ overlaps the answer input box when adding responses to the text and input interactions. This prevents typing in the response unless the Oppia feedback input panel is first opened. This hinders the user experience.\n\n### URL of the page where the issue is observed.\n\nhttp://localhost:8181/creator-dashboard\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1) Navigate to the Exploration Creator on the creator dashboard at mobile width(375*667) or on a mobile device\r\n2) Try to add responses to the text and input interactions.\r\n3) Notice that the text ‘Oppia, tell learner to’ overlaps the answer input box.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe text ‘Oppia, tell learner to’ should not overlap the answer input box, allowing the user to type in the response without having to open the Oppia feedback input panel.\n\n### Screenshots/Videos\n\n\r\nhttps://github.com/oppia/oppia/assets/124369508/8a3103b3-69c7-4a20-bab9-de80ecfbea82\r\n\r\n\n\n### What device are you using?\n\nDesktop\n\n### Operating System\n\nMacOS\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Browser version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Tips for developers\n\nBefore addressing the bug, please identify which PR caused the issue (you can follow the steps [here](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/How-to-find-the-commit-which-introduced-a-bug)). If you identify the PR, comment on the issue with a link to it. If not, mention the commit hash of the oldest commit you saw the bug on (and the month and year it was made in).\r\n\r\nThen, please leave a comment with details of the approach that you plan to take to fix the issue (see [example](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues/19157#issuecomment-1858788463)).\r\n\r\n**Note:** If this is your first Oppia issue, please make sure to follow our guidelines for [choosing an issue](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Contributing-code-to-Oppia#choosing-a-good-first-issue) and [setting things up](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Contributing-code-to-Oppia#setting-things-up). You will also need to show a demo of the fix working correctly on your local machine. Thanks!\r\n",
