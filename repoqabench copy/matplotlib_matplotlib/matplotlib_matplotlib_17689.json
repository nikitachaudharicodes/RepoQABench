  "issue_description": "# Add pause/resume methods to Animation baseclass\n\n\r\nAs pointed out in https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/17685 while you can pause an animation by reaching in and calling methods on the event source, when using `Animation` with blitting that is not enough, you also have to flip the animated artists back to non-animated.  This code (lightly modified from @Luluser question) is a proof-of-concept.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\nimport matplotlib.animation as animation\r\nfrom matplotlib.widgets import Button\r\n\r\n\r\nclass PlotAnimation:\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        self.fig, self.ax = plt.subplots()\r\n        self.x = np.linspace(-10, 10, 1000)\r\n        self.N = 200\r\n        self.interv = 50\r\n        self.n0 = (\r\n            1.0\r\n            / (4 * np.pi * 2e-4 * 0.1) ** 0.5\r\n            * np.exp(-self.x ** 2 / (4 * 2e-4 * 0.1))\r\n        )\r\n        (self.p,) = self.ax.plot(self.x, self.n0)\r\n        self.anim_running = True\r\n        self.Myanimation = animation.FuncAnimation(\r\n            self.fig, self.update, frames=self.N, interval=self.interv, blit=True\r\n        )\r\n\r\n    def update(self, i):\r\n        self.n0 += i / 100 % 5\r\n        self.p.set_ydata(self.n0 % 20)\r\n        return (self.p,)\r\n\r\n    def animate(self):\r\n        pause_ax = self.fig.add_axes((0.7, 0.025, 0.1, 0.04))\r\n        pause_button = Button(pause_ax, \"pause\", hovercolor=\"0.975\")\r\n        pause_button.on_clicked(self._pause)\r\n        plt.show()\r\n\r\n    def _pause(self, event):\r\n        if self.anim_running:\r\n            self.Myanimation.event_source.stop()\r\n            self.p.set_animated(False)\r\n            self.anim_running = False\r\n            self.fig.canvas.draw_idle()\r\n        else:\r\n            self.p.set_animated(True)\r\n            self.Myanimation.event_source.start()\r\n            self.anim_running = True\r\n\r\n\r\nanimated_plot = PlotAnimation()\r\nanimated_plot.animate()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code should be generalized and used to put a `pause` and `resume` methods on `Animation`.\r\n",
