That is all I was saying! Please do\nnot continue this false narrative.\n\nI like str.format()-style formatting for many reasons, particularly the\nability to create custom format notations, al la datetime objects. I\nactually have no objection with extending sanskey somehow to also include\nother formatting methods. Perhaps we could utilize the tick formatter\ninfrastructure to do this?\n\nThe only reason why I said anything in this conversation is to dispel the\nmyth that %-formatting is somehow obsolete and discouraged in python (your\nwords). In fact, the documentation makes it clear that there are times when\nhaving both types of formatting available is preferable (I don't have a\nreference on-hand, unfortunately). \"Obsolete and discouraged\" implies a\nmovement towards deprecation and removal from python, which is *not* the\ncase.\n\n\nOn Thu, Dec 17, 2020 at 9:38 PM CharlesHe16 <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> People can have opinions and prefer different ways of doing things.

We don't pick up coupled kwargs and there is a reliable way to tell which input the user gave us, and we maintain full back-compatibility.  \r\n\r\nIt also gives the user far _more_ power as now they can inject an arbitrary function and, for example, map number to emoji."

The fprint or string modulo seems arcane and is discouraged by Python 3 docs. \r\n\r\n>But you would have to make sure that %-style formatting is still supported and edge-cases (in particular using curly braces and % in the respective other format) are handled correctly.\r\n\r\nOk. So I would need to find a way to easily decide whether something is an f-strings format or a string modulo format.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, would you accept an additional parameter such as \"f_string_format\" in addition to \"format\", or is that too much gore?\r\n\r\n\n\n> No, f-string formatting can be separated, just as the fprint format is separated now. Try for yourself:\r\n\r\nThat example is not strictly equivalent to what's supported in `Sankey`, as it only determines the format of a value, whereas the %-string could contain anything so long as it only interpolated one value. In its usage, the format was only used for determining how a single value was formatted, but there was nothing ensuring that that would be the case, i.e., passing `format='Flow #%d'` was a possibility.\n\n@QuLogic this makes sense.\r\n\r\nI guess one solution is to have a second mode of use for when the user enters a tuple. \r\n\r\nThe first element of the tuple provides any additional text content, and the second element contains formatting for the f string.\r\n\r\nFor example `format=('test string %D', '.2f')` with the value of 5 produces `'test string 5.00'`.\r\n\r\nThis seems awkward and niche.\n\n> Not trying to argue or even persuade, but genuinely curious: things get deprecated all the time.\r\n\r\n> What is the criteria or threshold for changing the format?\r\n\r\nFor every deprecation we carefully weigh the benefit (clean, intuitive, consistent, ... API) against cost (users have to re-learn, existing code must be changed).\r\n\r\nFor the sankey format IMHO the benefit is small. It is true that %-formatting has its quirks but it's still a standard and well-known API of Python. And users of `format` will likely need to read the docs anyway to learn about the feature; either way `format` is not canonical enough so that a user could guess what can be passed. OTOH every user of `format` would be affected by the deprecation.\r\n\r\nI'm against different modes or multiple parameters. That would over-complicate the API. There should only be one `format` parameter and it should unambiguously specify what to do (even though multiple kinds of input may be permissive).\r\n\r\nCurrent API is\r\n~~~\r\nSankey(..., format='%.2f')\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nI could imaging extending to `str.format` (https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/stdtypes.html#str.format) i.e.\r\n~~~\r\nSankey(..., format='{0:.2f}')\r\n~~~\r\nis valid. That could possibly be checked by `re.match('.*{0(?:.*)}', format)` or similar. That would give you the full flexibility of the [Format String Syntax](https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/string.html#formatstrings).\r\n\r\nI don't see how an f-string can be helpful here.\n\nHi Tim,\r\n\r\n>For every deprecation we carefully weigh the benefit (clean, intuitive, consistent, ...

That is all I was saying! Please do\nnot continue this false narrative.\n\nI like str.format()-style formatting for many reasons, particularly the\nability to create custom format notations, al la datetime objects. I\nactually have no objection with extending sanskey somehow to also include\nother formatting methods. Perhaps we could utilize the tick formatter\ninfrastructure to do this?\n\nThe only reason why I said anything in this conversation is to dispel the\nmyth that %-formatting is somehow obsolete and discouraged in python (your\nwords). In fact, the documentation makes it clear that there are times when\nhaving both types of formatting available is preferable (I don't have a\nreference on-hand, unfortunately). \"Obsolete and discouraged\" implies a\nmovement towards deprecation and removal from python, which is *not* the\ncase.\n\n\nOn Thu, Dec 17, 2020 at 9:38 PM CharlesHe16 <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> People can have opinions and prefer different ways of doing things.

They all exist in the Python language which is something we have to support.   If you want to have a discussion about changing that or the relative strengths, please take that to python-ideas@python.org ;).\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nIf we were going to extend this API to support new-style format strings I think we should go the route (riffing on some of Antony's comments else where) of accepting either a string (which is formatted with `%`) or a callable that accepts a number and returns a string (so `'{.2f}'.format` would be a valid input).  We don't pick up coupled kwargs and there is a reliable way to tell which input the user gave us, and we maintain full back-compatibility.  \r\n\r\nIt also gives the user far _more_ power as now they can inject an arbitrary function and, for example, map number to emoji.\n\nIf folks agree with the `str` or `callable` path, I think this is a good first issue as the API extension is narrow and self-contained to the sankey code.  It will need docs, tests, an example, and a whats-new entry.\n\n> self-contained to the sankey code.\r\n\r\nThere are a few other places in matplotlib that have similar string formatting. It would be nice if a change to accept both types of formatting was applied uniformly across them. Most notable (to me at least) is the Slider widgets which also use `%` style formatting. grepping around I also found \r\nhttps://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/67aa50d164669a1340fe05e06dfc7223e25c87b3/lib/matplotlib/contour.py#L918-L919\r\n\r\nwhich only allows for callables. It would be nice these were all consistent and all allowed for both styles.\n\nI think `clabel` should probably be the gold-standard here?  https://matplotlib.org/3.3.0/api/contour_api.html#matplotlib.contour.ContourLabeler.clabel\r\n\r\n```\r\n        fmt : `.Formatter` or str or callable or dict, optional\r\n            How the levels are formatted:\r\n\r\n            - If a `.Formatter`, it is used to format all levels at once, using\r\n              its `.Formatter.format_ticks` method.\r\n            - If a str, it is interpreted as a %-style format string.\r\n            - If a callable, it is called with one level at a time and should\r\n              return the corresponding label.\r\n            - If a dict, it should directly map levels to labels.\r\n\r\n            The default is to use a standard `.ScalarFormatter`.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo maybe what `clabel` does should be made a `_api` helper and used elsewhere?   (basically `ContourLabeller.get_text`)\n\nI have a small concern about the Formatter and dict layers.  The first seems tuned to clabel needing many strings (not just one) and the second seems a shortcut to `fmt=lambda x: my_dict[x]`.\n\nAgree that `Formatter` and `dict` are not very useful in general, and in particular for Sankey.\r\n\r\nAlso, with str and callable, you can do everything.\n\nI think I understand @tacaswell's solution with the `str or callable` route. This makes sense.\r\n\r\nPlus, we could then measure flows in nyan cats: \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23063929/102678266-29dbcf00-415c-11eb-967a-c3f7d8a15164.png\" width=\"80\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23063929/102678266-29dbcf00-415c-11eb-967a-c3f7d8a15164.png\" width=\"80\">\r\n\r\nI see the issue is in \"unassigned\" and \"needs sorting\".
