Because ``iterrows`` returns a Series for each row,\n           it does **not** preserve dtypes across the rows (dtypes are\n           preserved across columns for DataFrames). For example,\n\n           >>> df = pd.DataFrame([[1, 1.5]], columns=['int', 'float'])\n           >>> row = next(df.iterrows())[1]\n           >>> row\n           int      1.0\n           float    1.5\n           Name: 0, dtype: float64\n           >>> print(row['int'].dtype)\n           float64\n           >>> print(df['int'].dtype)\n           int64\n\n           To preserve dtypes while iterating over the rows, it is better\n           to use :meth:`itertuples` which returns namedtuples of the values\n           and which is generally faster than ``iterrows``.\n\n        2. You should **never modify** something you are iterating over.\n           This is not guaranteed to work in all cases. Depending on the\n           data types, the iterator returns a copy and not a view, and writing\n           to it will have no effect.\n\n        Returns\n        -------\n        it : generator\n            A generator that iterates over the rows of the frame.\n\n        See also\n        --------\n        itertuples : Iterate over DataFrame rows as namedtuples of the values.\n        iteritems : Iterate over (column name, Series) pairs.\n\n        \"\"\"\n        columns = self.columns\n        klass = self._constructor_sliced\n        for k, v in zip(self.index, self.values):\n            s = klass(v, index=columns, name=k)\n            yield k, s\n\n    def itertuples(self, index=True, name=\"Pandas\"):\n        \"\"\"\n        Iterate over DataFrame rows as namedtuples, with index value as first\n        element of the tuple.\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        index : boolean, default True\n            If True, return the index as the first element of the tuple.\n        name : string, default \"Pandas\"\n            The name of the returned namedtuples or None to return regular\n            tuples.\n\n        Notes\n        -----\n        The column names will be renamed to positional names if they are\n        invalid Python identifiers, repeated, or start with an underscore.\n        With a large number of columns (>255), regular tuples are returned.\n\n        See also\n        --------\n        iterrows : Iterate over DataFrame rows as (index, Series) pairs.\n        iteritems : Iterate over (column name, Series) pairs.\n\n        Examples\n        --------\n\n        >>> df = pd.DataFrame({'col1': [1, 2], 'col2': [0.1, 0.2]},\n                              index=['a', 'b'])\n        >>> df\n           col1  col2\n        a     1   0.1\n        b     2   0.2\n        >>> for row in df.itertuples():\n        ...     print(row)\n        ...\n        Pandas(Index='a', col1=1, col2=0.10000000000000001)\n        Pandas(Index='b', col1=2, col2=0.20000000000000001)\n\n        \"\"\"\n        arrays = []\n        fields = []\n        if index:\n            arrays.append(self.index)\n            fields.append(\"Index\")\n\n        #

  "golden_answers_generated": [
    "The proposed change aims to allow dependent assignment using the 'assign' method in pandas DataFrames for Python 3.6 and later, where keyword argument order is guaranteed. This would enable users to create new columns in a DataFrame that depend on columns being assigned in the same method call, enhancing functionality and usability.",
    "The version check for Python 3.6+ is crucial because, starting with this version, Python guarantees the preservation of keyword argument order. This ensures that the order of assignments in the 'assign' method will be predictable, allowing for dependent assignments. Implementing this feature in earlier Python versions, where dictionary order isn't guaranteed, could lead to unpredictable behavior.",
    "The main concerns are related to backward compatibility and the risk of introducing subtle differences between Python 3.5 and 3.6. There's a risk that code relying on the new behavior might not work as expected in environments running older Python versions. Additionally, there's apprehension about how best to communicate or enforce this change to avoid unexpected results for users not aware of the version-specific behavior.",
    "In the current implementation, due to the function signature of 'assign' being **kwargs, the order of new columns in the resulting DataFrame cannot be guaranteed to match the order passed in. To ensure predictability, items are inserted alphabetically by key at the end of the DataFrame. All expressions are computed first, preventing references to another column being assigned in the same call.",
    "The proposed steps are: (1) No change for Python 2.7 to 3.5, where the order will continue to be sorted by key; (2) for Python 3.6 and later, use the original order passed by the user; (3) initially, do not allow dependent assignment to avoid issues, with a possibility of revisiting this decision in the future when usage of older Python versions declines."
