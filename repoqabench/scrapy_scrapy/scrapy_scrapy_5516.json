  "questions_generated": [
    "Why does the command `scrapy crawl -O <filename>.jsonl --output-format jl <spider_name>` result in the output file being appended rather than overwritten?",
    "What is the significance of the `-O` option in the `scrapy crawl` command within the context of this issue?",

    "What potential improvement is suggested in the discussion regarding ScrapyDeprecationWarning related to output formats?",
    "Why might the choice to support specific file extensions, like `.jl` and `.jsonlines`, but not `.jsonl`, be technically justified in Scrapy?"
  ],
  "golden_answers_generated": [
    "The command results in appending because the `--output-format` option is deprecated for specifying file formats. This option does not support file overwriting for custom extensions like `.jsonl`. The expected behavior is achieved by including the format in the output URI itself, such as `scrapy crawl -O <filename>.jsonl:jsonlines`, which allows the file to be overwritten.",
    "The `-O` option in the `scrapy crawl` command is used to specify the output file and its format directly. This option is designed to allow overwriting of existing files, unlike the deprecated `--output-format` option. The correct syntax using `-O` is `scrapy crawl -O <filename>.jsonl:jsonlines`, which specifies both the file name and the format, enabling the overwriting of the file.",
    "The repository's code handles different output formats through the `feed_process_params_from_cli` function, which processes command-line arguments to determine the appropriate feed format and configuration. This implementation is likely found in utility modules or within command handling sections, such as the `scrapy/commands/__init__.py` file, where command-line argument parsing and feed processing are managed.",
    "The potential improvement suggested is to enhance the ScrapyDeprecationWarning message by explicitly mentioning both the `-t` and `--output-format` options and providing an example of the recommended syntax. Additionally, the message could explain the limitations of the deprecated option, such as its inability to support file overwriting, to guide users towards adopting the newer syntax for specifying output formats.",
    "The choice to support specific file extensions like `.jl` and `.jsonlines` was likely made based on common usage standards and conventions within data processing tools. These extensions are widely recognized and used in other systems for JSON Lines format, ensuring compatibility and consistency. The discussion in the issue suggests that `.jsonl` was considered but not yet supported, possibly due to prioritizing established standards and minimizing potential confusion or compatibility issues with existing workflows."
