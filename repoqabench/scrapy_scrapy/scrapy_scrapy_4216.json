    "The main objective of the issue is to enhance the Scrapy logging documentation to clearly explain how to filter out specific log messages, particularly warnings that depend on input, which may need to be ignored due to their dependency on the content or behavior of the website being scraped.",
    "Exposing a setting or a LogFormatter method for each warning is considered unscalable because warnings can originate from various sources, including third-party Scrapy extensions, making it impractical to manage a custom setting or method for each potential warning message.",
    "The recommended steps for a contributor are: 1) Review the existing Scrapy logging documentation, 2) Research how to filter log messages based on content, such as substrings or regular expressions, and 3) Extend the advanced customization section of the logging documentation to include examples or details on filtering log messages.",
    "It is suggested to cover how to filter out log messages based on substrings, as this provides a straightforward method for users to filter specific messages. Additionally, the documentation can mention that regular expressions can be used for more complex filtering, with a reference to Python's official documentation on regular expressions.",
    "If the current pull request is incomplete or the original contributor is unavailable, another contributor may build upon the existing work or start a new proposal to address the issue. They should review the existing discussion and any provided guidance to ensure their contributions align with the project's goals."
