    "What are the main steps recommended for contributing to the issue on Scrapy logging documentation?",
    "Why is it suggested to cover filtering of log messages by substrings instead of regular expressions?",
    "What challenges might arise from exposing settings or LogFormatter methods for each warning message in Scrapy?",
    "In the context of Scrapy logging, why is it important to filter out specific log messages?",
    "How can a new contributor determine if their proposed solution for the Scrapy logging issue is complete?"
  ],
  "golden_answers_generated": [
    "The main steps recommended are: 1) Review the Scrapy logging documentation available at https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/logging.html. 2) Investigate how to filter out log messages based on the message contents, such as using substrings or regular expressions. 3) Extend the documentation section at https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/logging.html#advanced-customization to include examples or additional details about filtering log messages.",
    "It is suggested to cover filtering by substrings because it is simpler and generally sufficient for most use cases. Users who need more complex filtering can easily extend this understanding to regular expressions. Additionally, providing a link to the Python documentation on regular expressions allows users to explore this further if needed.",
    "Exposing settings or LogFormatter methods for each warning could become unscalable, especially when warnings originate from third-party Scrapy extensions. This approach would require managing potentially numerous settings or methods, complicating the codebase and increasing maintenance overhead.",
    "Filtering out specific log messages is important because some warnings may depend on external input, such as the content or behavior of the website being scraped. When developers cannot address the root cause of these warnings, filtering allows them to ignore irrelevant warnings that may clutter the logs and obscure more critical information.",
    "A new contributor can determine if their solution is complete by ensuring it addresses the main goals outlined in the issue discussion: documenting how to filter log messages by content and providing examples or extending the advanced customization section. Additionally, they should seek feedback from maintainers or other contributors, as seen when a pull request was created and reviewed by Gallaecio."
