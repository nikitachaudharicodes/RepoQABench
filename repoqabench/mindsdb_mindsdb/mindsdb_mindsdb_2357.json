  "issue_description": "# [New Integration]: Prometheus Monitoring Integration\n\n### Is there an existing integration?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the existing integrations.\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\nSo the engineering team has deployed the next big application on cloud servers, but how can they constantly \"keep eyes\" on the servers to assess its performance, health, and proactively detect and prevent any possible failure? This introduces the need for automated monitoring and instrumentation tools. \r\n\r\nPrometheus is a popular open-source instrumentation and monitoring system for cloud-native applications, which provides notable capabilities for \"scraping\" metrics from several target servers in a time-series format, analyzing these metrics, querying metrics, alerting etc. These metrics could include CPU usage, memory usage, disk or I/O activity, server status etc.\r\n\r\nPrometheus stores data in time-series form, and provides a querying language called PromQL for aggregating the time-series data for each metric. The result of the queries can be shown as a graph for visualization, or expressed in tabular form. \r\n\r\nPrometheus pulls data from data sources using lightweight agents installed on the data sources, these agents are called **exporters**. Prometheus also provides client libraries in Go, Python, Java etc. for instrumenting code directly. Prometheus provides third-party exporters and integrations with popular tools like Kubernetes, Grafana, SQL and NoSQL databases, modern alerting solutions etc. \r\n\r\nThe best part is that Prometheus is open-source and free, hence making integrations with other tools achievable.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nMachine learning has continued to drive digital transformation in several areas and industries. The primary motivation behind integrating MindsDB with Prometheus is to leverage the machine learning capabilities that MindsDB provides to gain actionable insights from the time-series data that Prometheus extracts from several data sources. \r\n\r\nThe two main machine learning capabilities that MindsDB can provide to improve the Prometheus observability experience are: - \r\n1. **Real-time Forecasting:-** Despite the growth in cloud infrastructure for deploying highly available applications, servers still experience failure (usually abruptly). Hence, we need a way to predict these failures and understand failure patterns, in order to proactively respond to them. To achieve this this, we need data (from Prometheus), and a \"brain\" to make predictions (MindsDB). We can extract time-series data from Prometheus, and train machine learning models for automatically forecasting future behavior of our applications from historical patterns. For instance, we can forecast a server failure or surge in CPU usage, and prevent the downtime this might cause.\r\n\r\n2. **Anomaly detection:-** In production environments, applications can usually drift from their expected behavior, causing possible failure or irregularities. Manual checks for anomalies is usually inefficient and inconvenient. Hence we need the machine learning capabilities that MindsDB provides to automatically predict possible anomalies from Prometheus data. This anomaly detection pipeline can be integrated with alerting tools that Prometheus provides to inform engineers if an anomaly has occurred. \r\n\r\nWith forecasting and anomaly detection, we can better understand the data Prometheus extracts from servers at scale, and make intelligent predictions. These predictions will help engineering teams detect failures and automatically prevent failures. This will in provide better customer satisfaction, improve business revenue, and improve developer productivity by adding another **\"mind\"** to the team. This is indeed a great motivation!\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\n\r\nThe implementation of this integration will include: - \r\n\r\n1. **Loading the data for specific metrics from Prometheus:-** As described in the documentation, Prometheus stores the data as a multi-dimensional data model, with streams of timestamped data points identified by metric name, and labelled using key/value pairs. This metrics data can be exposed via Prometheus APIs or HTTP endpoints and queried via PromQL. \r\n\r\n2. **Training a model for forecasting and anomaly detection:-** A MindsDB model can hence be trained on the extracted data for forecasting and anomaly detection. \r\n\r\n3. **Making inference: -** Inference can be made in real-time, and the results can be sent back to Prometheus. These predictions can then be sent from Prometheus to other tools like Grafana for visualizing forecasts, or AlertManager for alerting when an anomaly occurs. \r\n\r\n>This implementation promises to be improved, as it is still in an immature stage of conception. **A high-level implementation diagram has been added below: -**\r\n\r\n![mindsdb-prometheus-integration drawio (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38814629/173975241-41dd8a4a-3d3d-42b5-8639-3468a065389d.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n A detailed description of Prometheus's benefits, integrations, and use cases can be found on its [website](https://prometheus.io).\r\n ",

    "The primary purpose of integrating MindsDB with Prometheus is to leverage MindsDB's machine learning capabilities to gain actionable insights from the time-series data that Prometheus extracts from several data sources. This includes capabilities like real-time forecasting and anomaly detection to predict server failures and detect anomalies in production environments.",
    "MindsDB plans to use the data collected by Prometheus to train machine learning models for forecasting future behaviors and detecting anomalies. The integration will allow MindsDB to extract time-series data from Prometheus, process it, and make predictions that can, for example, forecast server failures or CPU usage surges.",
    "In the Prometheus monitoring system, 'exporters' are lightweight agents installed on data sources that pull data from these sources. They help in collecting metrics data that Prometheus can then scrape. This data is typically stored in a multi-dimensional data model and can be queried using PromQL.",
    "The PrometheusHandler class in the repository is responsible for handling the integration between MindsDB and Prometheus. It likely manages the communication with Prometheus, retrieves metrics data, and interfaces with MindsDB's machine learning models to perform tasks such as data selection, query handling, and processing results.",
    "The `__about__.py` file defines key metadata for the Prometheus integration, such as the title ('MindsDB Prometheus handler'), package name ('mindsdb_prometheus_handler'), version ('0.0.1'), description, author, GitHub link, PyPI link, license (GPL-3.0), and copyright information.",
    "Prometheus stores data in a time-series format, organized as a multi-dimensional data model with streams of timestamped data points identified by metric names and labeled using key/value pairs. Prometheus provides a querying language called PromQL, which allows for aggregating and analyzing this time-series data, and results can be visualized or presented in tabular form.",
    "The `select` method in the PrometheusTable class is responsible for executing a data selection query. It extracts comparison conditions from the query's WHERE clause and sets parameters for querying Prometheus, such as the query itself, start and end times, and time step for data retrieval.",
    "The expected outcomes include the ability to perform real-time forecasting to predict server failures or unexpected surges in resource usage, and to perform anomaly detection to identify deviations from expected behavior in production environments. These capabilities aim to enhance observability and allow for proactive measures to prevent failures.",
    "The integration plans to handle visualization by sending predictions back to Prometheus, which can then forward them to tools like Grafana for visualization. For alerting, predictions indicating anomalies can be sent to Prometheus's AlertManager to notify engineering teams when an anomaly is detected."
