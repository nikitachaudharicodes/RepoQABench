  ],
  "golden_answers_generated": [
    "The main bug reported in the issue is the missing `__init__.py` files in certain subdirectories of the test structure, leading to `ModuleNotFoundError` errors. This affects new contributors by preventing them from running tests locally without manually adding these files, which can be a confusing blocker for those unfamiliar with Pytest and Python package structures.",
    "`__init__.py` files are important in test directories because they define the directory as a Python package. This allows Pytest to recognize and import modules correctly, thereby preventing `ModuleNotFoundError` errors when trying to run tests. Without these files, Python might not be able to locate and import the modules, causing the tests to fail.",
    "Contributors suggest running tests locally using the command `python -m pytest` from the `tests` directory, or targeting specific directories with `python -m pytest ./path/to/test_file.py`. If `__init__.py` files are missing, the tests will fail with errors indicating that no tests were collected due to module import issues. This helps identify which subdirectories require the addition of `__init__.py` files to fix the problem.",
    "Before running the tests, a contributor should ensure that they have installed all necessary dependencies. This involves running `pip install -r requirements.txt` and `pip install -r requirements_test.txt`. Depending on the specific tests, additional dependencies may need to be installed from the `requirements.txt` files located in the directories of specific database or machine learning handlers.",
    "To verify that the issue is resolved, contributors are advised to rerun the tests after adding the necessary `__init__.py` files. The absence of `ModuleNotFoundError` errors and successful test execution will indicate that the missing files have been correctly added and the issue is resolved.",
    "Contributors might face challenges related to their local setup, such as not using a virtual environment, which can cause import errors. The discussion addresses these challenges by suggesting that contributors follow the specified testing commands and ensure all dependencies are installed. Additionally, contributors are given the option to seek assistance or confirm their findings with the maintainers if they encounter unexpected issues."
