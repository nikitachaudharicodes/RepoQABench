  "golden_answers_generated": [
    "The tests are not being executed because their names do not start with 'test_', which is the convention used by pytest to discover and run test cases. As a result, these tests are not picked up during test runs.",
    "The suggested steps include renaming the test functions so their names start with 'test_', running the tests to check if they pass, and then staging, committing, and pushing the changes to create a pull request.",
    "The last two tests might not pass due to the way boolean values are being handled. Specifically, the 'True' and 'False' values are being converted to '1.0' and '0.0' when processed through 'ensure_clean', 'to_json', and 'read_json', which causes the tests to fail.",
    "The 'ensure_clean' function is likely used to manage temporary files or paths during testing. It ensures that any files created during the test are cleaned up afterward. However, it seems to also influence the data format during the test execution, contributing to the conversion issues observed with boolean values.",
    "Pre-commit hooks can be configured to enforce naming conventions for test functions, ensuring they start with 'test_'. This would help prevent situations where tests are not run because they are not named correctly. Removing specific lines from the '.pre-commit-config.yaml' file, as suggested, could be part of setting up these hooks."
