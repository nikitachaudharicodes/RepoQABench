The usual solution is some combination of \"don't use it for everything\", \"turn down the `max_examples` setting in CI\", and \"just deal with it\".  \r\n* All hypothesis tests automatically apply a pytest marker to themselves too, so you can include or exclude them with `-m hypothesis` or `-m \"not hypothesis\"`.

    "The purpose of integrating Hypothesis into the pandas test suite is to leverage its support for generating pandas objects, which can be useful for testing higher-level methods such as 'melt' and 'merge'. Hypothesis can help discover edge cases and potential bugs by generating a wide range of test inputs, including those that might not have been considered manually.",
    "Hypothesis ensures reproducibility of failing test cases by caching them. When a failing test case is found, it is stored in a test database located in a '.hypothesis' directory. This allows for consistent re-running of the same failing case to aid in debugging and resolving issues.",
    "In the 'test_simple' method, Hypothesis is used to generate random lists of single-character strings and sequences of integers. The method uses these generated inputs to test the 'cartesian_product' function from the pandas library. It ensures that the outputs match the expected results by comparing them with manually constructed arrays using assertions.",
    "One concern raised was the potential increase in test times due to the use of Hypothesis. This can be addressed by setting a limit on the number of examples generated per test case, as shown in the code context where 'max_examples=20' is specified. This helps control the test execution time while still benefiting from Hypothesis's random input generation.",
    "The 'test_datetimeindex' method is a regression test for the GitHub issue #6439, which involves ensuring consistent ordering of 'DatetimeIndex'. Hypothesis generates random dates within a specified range, and the test checks that the 'cartesian_product' function maintains consistent ordering when applied to date ranges. This helps verify that the issue is resolved and that the function behaves as expected with datetime inputs."
