  "golden_answers_generated": [
    "The main goal of the issue is to standardize the references to 'pandas' in the documentation files to ensure consistency. Specifically, it suggests using the form 'pandas' uniformly across all documentation files instead of varying formats like 'Pandas', 'pandas', and '*pandas*'.",
    "A lint rule cannot be implemented for this task because the documentation needs to maintain flexibility in references and hyperlinks, which might not conform to a strict pattern. Enforcing a lint rule could potentially disrupt these necessary variations.",
    "The documentation files that need standardization are located in the `doc/source/../*.rst` directory within the pandas repository.",
    "The consensus after the discussion was to use 'pandas' without any italics or capitalization as the standard form in the documentation. This was preferred to avoid unnecessary formatting and to maintain consistency.",
    "Yes, a previous pull request (https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/32439) addressed the standardization of references to 'pandas' in the 'development/*.rst' files, but this issue aims to extend that effort to other parts of the documentation."
