    "for the `s1 = s1 - 4` case, the expected output remains as \r\n\r\n```\r\n# 0    1\r\n# 1    2\r\n# 2    3\r\n# dtype: int64\r\n```\r\n\r\n> When using normal assignment operators `s1 = s1 - 4` the problem is not present, which leads to inconsistent behavior.\r\n\r\nin Python, the `a = a+1` is not __always__ equivalent to `a+=1`.\r\n\r\nUnder the hood, Python calls 'special methods' for the various syntactical constructs. in this case `__add__` and `__iadd__`\r\n\r\nif the object, in this case `a`, implements `__iadd__`, that will be called. In the case of mutable sequences, `a` will change in place. However, when `a` does not implement `__iadd__`, the expression `a+=1` has the same effect as \r\n`a = a+1`. The expression `a+1` will be evaluated first, producing a new object, which is then bound to `a`. In other words, the object bound to `a` may or may not change, depending on whether `a` implements `__iadd__`\r\n\r\nIn general, for mutable sequences, it is common for `__iadd__` to be implemented and that `+=` happens inplace. For immutable sequences, clearly there is no way for that to happen.\r\n\r\nA pandas Series is a mutable sequence that implements `__iadd__`",

    "What is the main issue reported in pandas version 1.1.4 regarding augmented arithmetic assignments on sliced Series?",
    "How does the behavior of augmented arithmetic assignments differ from normal assignments in the reported issue?",

  "golden_answers_generated": [
    "In pandas version 1.1.4, when applying augmented arithmetic assignments like '+=', '-=', '*=', or '/=' on a Series 's1' that is sliced from an original Series 's', the changes affect the original Series 's'. This behavior is inconsistent with the use of normal assignment operators, where a similar operation does not propagate changes to the original Series.",
    "The behavior differs in that augmented arithmetic assignments modify the original Series from which the slice was taken, whereas normal assignment operations do not. For example, using 's1 -= 4' modifies both 's1' and the original Series 's', while 's1 = s1 - 4' only modifies 's1', leaving 's' unchanged.",
    "The change was introduced in commit 'd8c8cbb90544b77e5da1daa7274eba7bef3257b9' to fix a regression related to inplace operations for DataFrames. This commit aimed to ensure that inplace operations actually modify the data inplace, but it inadvertently affected the behavior of Series slices with augmented arithmetic assignments.",
    "The bug was introduced in pandas version 1.1.4. Prior versions did not exhibit this behavior where changes to sliced Series using augmented arithmetic assignments propagate to the original Series.",
    "The bug can lead to unexpected side effects during data manipulation tasks where slices of a Series are used. Users expecting isolated changes to slices may inadvertently alter the original data, leading to potential data integrity issues and incorrect results in data analysis workflows."
