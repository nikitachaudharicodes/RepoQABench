    "The 'Create an Exploration' and 'Browse our Explorations' buttons on the creator guidelines page are hard to see and find. They lack proper button formatting such as borders, contrasting colors, and clear visibility.",
    "The CSS class .btn.oppia-about-button in the playbook.component.css file might need modification. Adjusting properties like background-color, color, borders, and padding could enhance button visibility and contrast.",
    "Before addressing the issue, a developer should identify which PR caused the problem by following the steps outlined in the oppia wiki. They must then comment on the issue with the PR link or the commit hash where the bug was first observed. Additionally, they should provide details of their planned approach to fix the issue.",
    "The repository suggests using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) to run make commands on Windows using VSCode, as Powershell might not recognize 'make' as a command.",
    "The buttons should be easier to see with proper formatting, including borders and contrasting colors to stand out better against the page background.",
    "The developer needs to show a demo of the fix working correctly on their local machine and ensure that the changes are aligned with the repository's contribution guidelines.",
    "The make command might not be recognized because Powershell is being used as the terminal, which does not support Unix-based commands by default. Switching to WSL or installing make in the Windows environment can resolve this issue."
