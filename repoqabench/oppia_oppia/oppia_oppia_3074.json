This feeling seems to occur before the learner has actually read the card, so it's likely due to the visual height of the card being too large.\r\n\r\nIn order to encourage people to create lessons that students would play through to the end, we would like to show a notification/warning of some kind if the content part of a card gets too large. We could detect this by having an offscreen \"shadow\" preview of the card, and calculating the height of this card when a change to the card's content is made, toggling the warning display appropriately. The warning would suggest that the exploration creator splits the long card into two, and \"teases\" the second one from the first (e.g. \"click 'Continue' to learn more about how to do X\").\r\n\r\nNote to contributors: please provide a mock or two showing what you'd like the creator experience to look like, before tackling the coding part of this issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n/cc @rachelwchen ",

I think the length of your message isn't\ntoo bad, actually -- as long as it doesn't exceed two lines.\n\nOn a second thought, is there perhaps another word for \"card\"? I know we\nrefer to it as a card, but would creators (especially first-time creators)\nknow that?\n\nThanks!\n\n\nOn Thu, Mar 2, 2017 at 6:00 PM Sean Lip <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> So I'm not too worried about the visuals, but I have a question about the\n> text -- is it actually understandable?

The context may be sufficient to indicate what the message refers to, though, so I'm fine with \"card\" unless anyone has a better suggestion.\n\n@seanlip the message looks fine to me. Also I think creators would be able to understand 'card' in this context.\n\n@seanlip I think the message is not \"computer-ish\" and it conveys the right message! I really liked the suggestion - \"consider shortening it, or breaking it into two cards\". If the message can be displayed in a way that is neither too glaring nor visually unappealing then I'm absolutely fine with seeing this message (as a creator).\n\nHi @seanlip, may I take this up using the approach which is discussed on the issue, Thanks!",

    "I'd prefer something more gentle & less computer-ish -- just in case the\nusers don't know what 630px means. Something like\n\n\"You've reached the suggested card height!\"\n\nAlso, I feel that the red text combined with the (!) icon makes the message\nlook like an error message, rather than a friendly reminder. Perhaps pick\nanother color -- blue or orange? --  OR take the (!) out?\n\nThank you @srikar.ch!\n\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Feb 28, 2017 at 4:07 AM srikar.ch <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> @seanlip <https://github.com/seanlip> what should be there in the warning\n> message?\n> [image: image]\n> <https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17567875/23404733/7a6dbae0-fddc-11e6-883c-ed48996859a8.png>\n>\n> —\n> You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues/3074#issuecomment-283022514>, or mute\n> the thread\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ALmJ21q1p0JXhZvgDK18CtHlrk5uz-pwks5rhA4AgaJpZM4MC0Ql>\n> .\n>\n-- \nRachel Chen Sent from mobile."

    "The proposed solution involves having an offscreen 'shadow' preview of the card. This allows for consistent height measurement regardless of the user's screen resolution, as the rendering of the card's content will be identical to how it would appear on the actual screen.",
    "The decision to use height as the measurement criteria stems from user tests indicating that the perception of a card being 'long' is more visual than textual. Users tend to react to the visual length of the card rather than counting characters, making height a more relevant metric.",
    "The 'interactionDetailsCache' factory is used to store interaction details specific to a state. It caches customization arguments corresponding to an interaction ID, allowing restoration of these details if the interaction is reverted while the user is still editing the state.",
    "The warning notification should be non-intrusive and appear ambiently, possibly as a light red warning below the RTE. It should not block normal operation, allowing creators to continue without being forced to alter their content immediately.",
    "A directive could be created to watch the height of the content card. This directive would trigger a function to append a warning message when the content height exceeds 630px, ensuring the notification is displayed dynamically as content changes.",
    "The 'StateInteraction' controller likely manages the interaction aspects of a state's editor, which would include handling user inputs and changes to the content card. It can be extended to include logic for checking the card's height and triggering the warning display.",
    "Requiring mocks ensures that the contributors have a clear and agreed-upon vision of the UI changes before any code is written. This helps prevent misunderstandings and aligns expectations between contributors and maintainers, streamlining the development process.",
    "An offscreen directive allows for accurate measurement of the card's rendered height without being affected by the current layout or viewport constraints. This ensures that the measurement is consistent and unaffected by other elements present in the UI.",
    "The height warning mechanism could be integrated by utilizing the 'stateInteractionIdService' and 'stateCustomizationArgsService' to monitor changes to the card content. When a change is detected, the directive could recalculate the card's height and update the warning message accordingly."
