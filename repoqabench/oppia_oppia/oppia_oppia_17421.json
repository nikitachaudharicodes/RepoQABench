Thank you.\n\nOpened a Draft PR(WIP), will be ready to review by EOW. Thanks\n\nJust a heads up that the PR I created for this issue https://github.com/oppia/oppia/pull/18071, has already been approved. Just some tests were failing, but I didn't have time to work on it properly. If Anyone's willing to work on this, feel free to use my PR as reference or you can also make a branch out of it and fix only the tests. Thanks.\n\nNot sure if @prafulbbandre is working on this, so I deassigned him. This issue is open for others to take up.\n\nHey, @seanlip @dchen97 I see this issue is still open and not assigned... I would like to take it up.\n\nHey @hrshkshri, assigning you the issue, checkout this comment https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues/17421#issuecomment-1751919657 for guidance.\n\nHey @Ash-2k3, Thanks... will do : )\n\nHey @seanlip, @dchen97, @Ash-2k3 ... I just raised a draft PR #19033 \r\nPlease look through if any changes are needed.\n\nfixed https://github.com/oppia/oppia/commit/acc8c5b9782e3901f39b17f6c1b75363f34b1b83",

    "The primary tasks include updating the Volunteer page with new designs and writing, and removing the Credits page as it is deemed unnecessary.",
    "The resources provided include design mockups on Figma and a UX document on Google Docs. These should be used to guide the redesign of the Volunteer page to ensure it aligns with the updated designs and writing specifications.",
    "There was confusion about whether to remove the volunteer-banner and footer sections, as the UX document had a line through them. However, it was clarified that these sections should remain as the document referred to an old version of a page redesign.",
    "The oppia-volunteer-banner class is used to style the banner section of the Volunteer page, which includes headings, content, and a call-to-action button for applying as a volunteer.",
    "The component uses the <picture> element with <source> tags to provide different image formats (WebP and PNG) for different devices, ensuring compatibility and performance optimization across desktop and mobile views.",
    "The ngIf directive is not directly visible in the given code snippet, but the component uses class-based media queries (e.g., hide-xs, hide-sm) to manage the display of images, ensuring the appropriate image is shown based on the device size.",
    "To remove the Credits page, the associated HTML, CSS, and any backend or routing logic that supports the Credits page must be deleted or refactored. This includes removing references to the Credits page in the application’s routing configuration and any links that navigate to it.",
    "It was important to refer to the design mocks because they provided the most up-to-date and accurate representation of the intended changes, whereas the UX document contained outdated information that could lead to incorrect assumptions about which sections to keep or remove."
