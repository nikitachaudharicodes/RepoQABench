    "To make the 'Add to play later' button visible on mobile devices, you should follow these steps: 1) Clone and install the Oppia repository and ensure you can run the development server. 2) Navigate to line 47 in `core/templates/components/summary-tile/collection-summary-tile.component.html` to find the mobile UI for the cards. 3) Add the play later icon to the card, ensuring that clicking on the icon executes a function similar to `addToLearnerPlaylist` as defined in `core/templates/pages/learner-dashboard-page/learner-dashboard-icons.component.ts`.",
    "The function to be mimicked is `addToLearnerPlaylist`, which is defined in `core/templates/pages/learner-dashboard-page/learner-dashboard-icons.component.ts`.",
    "The 'Add to play later' button might not appear on mobile devices if the mobile UI for exploration cards does not include the play later icon. Another possibility is that the function to handle adding to the playlist is not correctly linked to the UI element on mobile.",
    "The file to edit is `core/templates/components/summary-tile/collection-summary-tile.component.html`, specifically starting at line 47, where the mobile UI for the cards is defined.",
    "The guidance suggests adding the play later icon to the exploration cards within the mobile UI. The icon should be set to execute a function similar to `addToLearnerPlaylist` when clicked. This involves modifying the HTML template and possibly the TypeScript component to handle the logic.",
    "The decision to reuse or recreate functions should consider the context and the need for code DRYness (Don't Repeat Yourself). If the existing function in `learner-dashboard-ids-backend-api.service.ts` meets the requirements without modifications, it should be reused. However, if the feature on mobile requires a different implementation or additional functionalities, it might be necessary to recreate or extend the function.",
    "Technical challenges may include ensuring the UI component fits well within the existing mobile layout, handling touch interactions effectively, and managing state across different devices and screen sizes. Additionally, ensuring that the function to add items to the learner playlist is properly integrated and doesn't introduce performance issues is crucial."
