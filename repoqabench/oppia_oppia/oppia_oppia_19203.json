Here's a breakdown of the changes I propose to make in the `translation-modal.component.html` file:\r\n\r\n**Proposed Changes:**\r\nI will modify the `translation-modal.component.html` file, specifically in the section where the incomplete translation message is displayed. The current code looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<!-- core/templates/pages/contributor-dashboard-page/modal-templates/translation-modal.component.html -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Existing Code -->\r\n<p *ngIf=\"hasIncompleteTranslationError\">\r\n  Translation is incomplete.

Please use the Copy Tool to include any images or concept cards in the translated content.\r\n</p>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Explanation:**\r\nThe idea is to make the message more approachable.
