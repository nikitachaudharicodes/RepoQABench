  "issue_description": "# In E2E tests, re-do build and dependency installation when build files not available\n\nWe currently delete the `build_files` artifact in GitHub Actions after 1 day. This artifact contains the build that the E2E tests need to run, which means that contributors currently only have 1 day to get their E2E tests passing (i.e. by rerunning them) before they have to rerun all the tests.\n\nIf the build artifact is not available, we should automatically re-generate it by installing dependencies and performing the production build. Note that to solve this issue, you will need to figure out a way to tell whether a build artifact is available.\n\nThis issue was raised here:\n\n* https://github.com/oppia/oppia/pull/17506#issuecomment-1447855041\n\n",

I will update this!\n\nPrevious PR was closed because I accidentally force-pushed in one of the commits. I will open another PR soon; before the 1st PR was closed, I got almost all the E2E tests to pass so I believe all I really need to do left is test the re-construction of the artifact.\n\n> Previous PR was closed because I accidentally force-pushed in one of the commits.

As for updating when it will be merged, it should be at latest this Friday, since I still need to re-run tests and make sure that it works correctly when the artifact does not exist by re-running the e2e_test specifically.\n\nthanks for updating @CaryXiao1 ",

    "@Khadim-swe if you want to work on this issue, please follow our [instructions for taking up a good first issue](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Contributing-code-to-Oppia#choosing-a-good-first-issue). Specifically, make sure your comment \"describes in more detail how you'd tackle the issue (e.g. explain which file(s) you would modify and what changes you would make). If your explanation makes sense, we'll assign the issue to you.\"",
    "@tehami02 I think your solution would work, but I think we do it a little more efficiently. In the `e2e_test` job, we currently download the build artifact, which fails if it's missing:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/oppia/oppia/blob/3628528c259cbf9ada8b850db5d1eb0e4536c8d5/.github/workflows/e2e_tests.yml#L137\r\n\r\nInstead, we can check whether the artifact exists (using the code you suggested in https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues/17531#issuecomment-1455121191). If the artifact exists, we download and unzip it. If it doesn't exist, we run the build and installation steps again. (I don't think it makes sense to re-upload the artifact since reruns should be uncommon). Does that make sense?"

    "The `build_files` artifact contains the production build that the E2E tests require to run. It is crucial for ensuring that the tests operate under the same conditions as they would in a production environment.",
    "The `build_files` artifact is deleted after 1 day due to limited artifact storage space on GitHub. The build artifacts can be quite large, over 1 GB, which necessitates managing storage constraints.",
    "Contributors have only 1 day to rerun their E2E tests to get them passing before the `build_files` artifact is deleted. If the artifact is deleted, they have to regenerate it by reinstalling dependencies and performing the production build.",
    "One can use the GitHub API to check if the artifact ID is present or empty, indicating whether the `build_files` artifact is available or not.",
    "Two strategies were suggested: implementing an alert upon artifact deletion and using the GitHub API to list the content of the artifact's parent directory to check for availability.",
    "Increasing the retention period is not feasible due to the large size of the build artifacts, which could lead to running out of GitHub's limited artifact storage space.",
    "The proposed method involves running a scheduled workflow every day at midnight. This workflow checks if the `build_files` artifact exists and is recent. If not, it installs dependencies and performs a production build to regenerate the artifact.",
    "Technical challenges include determining the most efficient way to check artifact availability using the GitHub API, managing API rate limits, and ensuring that the solution integrates seamlessly with the existing E2E testing framework."
