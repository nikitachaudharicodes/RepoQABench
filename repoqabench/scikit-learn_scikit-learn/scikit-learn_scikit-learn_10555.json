    "The fetch_california_housing function is used to load the California housing dataset, which is a popular dataset for regression tasks. It provides housing data from California based on the 1990 census, including features like median income, house age, and location coordinates.",
    "The documentation for the fetch_california_housing function should be added to the 'doc/datasets/index.rst' file in the scikit-learn repository. This file serves as the index for dataset documentation, and the function should be included there to ensure it's part of the user guide.",
    "To contribute documentation changes, you should fork the repository, create a new branch, make your changes in the appropriate files, and then submit a pull request. It's advised to keep all related changes in a single pull request and follow the contribution guidelines provided at http://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/contributing.html.",
    "In Git, you can modify or add multiple files in a single pull request by committing all the changes you want to include in your branch. Ensure you stage all the files you've modified or added before committing, and then push the changes to your fork. Finally, create a pull request from this branch to the main repository.",
    "A new contributor might face challenges such as understanding the repository structure, learning how to properly format documentation, and using Git for version control. They might also need to understand the process for submitting pull requests and addressing review comments from maintainers.",
    "New contributors can learn about contributing to scikit-learn by visiting the contribution guidelines at http://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/contributing.html. Additionally, they can use resources like GitHub's desktop client for easier version control and tutorials like https://try.github.io/ for learning Git basics."
