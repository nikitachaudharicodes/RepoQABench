I don't want to use LeavePGroupsOut since I need to separate data according my desired percantages into training and validation sets. In the documentation of GroupShuffleSplit, for `test_size` parameter, it's said that:\r\n> test_size : float, int, None, optional\r\nIf float, should be between 0.0 and 1.0 and represent the proportion of the dataset to include in the test split. **If int, represents the absolute number of test samples**. If None, the value is set to the complement of the train size. By default, the value is set to 0.2. The default will change in version 0.21. It will remain 0.2 only if train_size is unspecified, otherwise it will complement the specified train_size.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is indeed not the case as in the following code:\r\n\r\n#### Steps/Code to Reproduce\r\n<!--\r\nExample:\r\n```python\r\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\r\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import LatentDirichletAllocation\r\n\r\ndocs = [\"Help I have a bug\" for i in range(1000)]\r\n\r\nvectorizer = CountVectorizer(input=docs, analyzer='word')\r\nlda_features = vectorizer.fit_transform(docs)\r\n\r\nlda_model = LatentDirichletAllocation(\r\n    n_topics=10,\r\n    learning_method='online',\r\n    evaluate_every=10,\r\n    n_jobs=4,\r\n)\r\nmodel = lda_model.fit(lda_features)\r\n```\r\nIf the code is too long, feel free to put it in a public gist and link\r\nit in the issue: https://gist.github.com\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- (1)\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    tr, ts = next(GroupShuffleSplit(n_splits=1, test_size=3).split(TR_set, groups=tr_groups))\r\n    print(tr)\r\n    print(ts)\r\n```\r\n\r\n- (2)\r\n```python\r\n    tr, ts = next(GroupShuffleSplit(n_splits=1, test_size=0.1).split(TR_set, groups=tr_groups))\r\n    print(len(tr))\r\n    print(len(ts))\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Actual Results\r\n<!-- Please paste or specifically describe the actual output or traceback. -->\r\nwhich prints out for instance:\r\n\r\n- (1)\r\n`[  0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17\r\n  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37\r\n  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55\r\n  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63  64  65  66  67  68  69  70  71  72  73\r\n  74  75  76  77  78  79  80  81  82  83  84  85  86  87  88  91  92  93\r\n  99 101 102 103 104 105 106 107]\r\n[ 26  27  89  90  94  95  96  97  98 100]`\r\n\r\n- (2)\r\n`70\r\n38\r\n`\r\n\r\nAs you see above from (1), test size is not 3 but more than 3. This almost always the case. I checked the groups of the indices. Apparently, if test_size is an integer, it represents the absolute number of test groups, **not samples**. I think you need to fix the documentation since it's misleading.\r\n\r\nAlso, when test_size is a float, it mostly does not consider the ratio specified. It may be due to unequal sample sizes in the groups but then there must be a note/warning to specify what kind of behaviour it follows under unequal group sizes combined with test_size ratio. From (2), test size is 35% of the whole set where it supposed to be 10%.\r\n\r\nSo, either I'm missing something or the documentation is nothing but erroneous descriptions.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\n<!--\r\nPlease run the following snippet and paste the output below.\r\nFor scikit-learn >= 0.20:\r\nimport sklearn; sklearn.show_versions()\r\nFor scikit-learn < 0.20:\r\nimport platform; print(platform.platform())\r\nimport sys; print(\"Python\", sys.version)\r\nimport numpy; print(\"NumPy\", numpy.__version__)\r\nimport scipy; print(\"SciPy\", scipy.__version__)\r\nimport sklearn; print(\"Scikit-Learn\", sklearn.__version__)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for contributing! -->\r\n\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.7.1 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 13 2018, 18:15:35)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/burak/anaconda3/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-45-generic-x86_64-with-debian-buster-sid\r\n\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/burak/anaconda3/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\n\r\nPython deps:\r\n       pip: 18.1\r\nsetuptools: 40.2.0\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.1\r\n     numpy: 1.15.4\r\n     scipy: 1.1.0\r\n    Cython: 0.28.5\r\n    pandas: 0.23.4",

Indeed, the ratio specified corresponds to ratio of the number of groups in the test set and the total number of groups in the data set. So, if you have 3 groups (no matter the size of each of them) and `test_size` is set to 0.1, `GroupShuffleSplit.split` will generate a test set with at least 10% of the number of groups in the dataset : 3 * 0.1 = 0.3, the test set will contain 0.3 different group (rounded up) so 1 group.\r\n\r\nSo, I agree the behavior is normal but there is no need of a warning because it's actually the expected behavior as explained in the doc:\r\n\r\n> Note: The parameters `test_size` and `train_size` refer to groups, and not to samples, as in ShuffleSplit.\r\n\r\nMaybe we should be more explicit in the description of the parameter (based on `train_size` parameter):\r\n\r\n> test_size : float, int, or None, default is None\r\n> If float, should be between 0.0 and 1.0 and represent the proportion of the **groups** to include in the test split (rounded up).

    "> Also, when test_size is a float, it mostly does not consider the ratio specified. It may be due to unequal sample sizes in the groups but then there must be a note/warning to specify what kind of behaviour it follows under unequal group sizes combined with test_size ratio. From (2), test size is 35% of the whole set where it supposed to be 10%.\r\n\r\nThe parameter `test_size` is not ignored when it is a float. Indeed, the ratio specified corresponds to ratio of the number of groups in the test set and the total number of groups in the data set. So, if you have 3 groups (no matter the size of each of them) and `test_size` is set to 0.1, `GroupShuffleSplit.split` will generate a test set with at least 10% of the number of groups in the dataset : 3 * 0.1 = 0.3, the test set will contain 0.3 different group (rounded up) so 1 group.\r\n\r\nSo, I agree the behavior is normal but there is no need of a warning because it's actually the expected behavior as explained in the doc:\r\n\r\n> Note: The parameters `test_size` and `train_size` refer to groups, and not to samples, as in ShuffleSplit.\r\n\r\nMaybe we should be more explicit in the description of the parameter (based on `train_size` parameter):\r\n\r\n> test_size : float, int, or None, default is None\r\n> If float, should be between 0.0 and 1.0 and represent the proportion of the **groups** to include in the test split (rounded up). If int, represents the absolute number of test **groups**. If None, the value is automatically set to the complement of the test size.\r\n\r\nI notice the ratio is rounded up for `test_size` and rounded down for `train_size`."

    "The documentation states that if `test_size` is an integer, it represents the absolute number of test samples. However, in practice, it represents the absolute number of test groups, not samples. This discrepancy leads to a misunderstanding of how the test split is calculated, especially when the integer is provided.",
    "The issue likely arises due to unequal sample sizes across the groups. When `test_size` is a float, it should represent the proportion of the dataset to include in the test split. However, because groups can have unequal sizes, achieving an exact proportion of samples might not be feasible, leading to deviations from the expected split ratio.",
    "`GroupShuffleSplit` is intended to create a random permutation of the groups and split them into training and test sets based on the specified sizes or proportions. It's designed for situations where data is naturally divided into groups that should not be split across the training and test sets. In contrast, `LeavePGroupsOut` is used to leave out a fixed number of groups for testing, which is more suited to scenarios where one wants to evaluate the model's performance on specific groups left out of the training. `GroupShuffleSplit` allows for more flexibility in creating balanced splits based on the desired proportions.",
    "The suggestion was to explicitly state in the documentation that if `test_size` is an integer, it represents the number of test groups rather than test samples. Additionally, a note or warning should be included to explain the potential discrepancies in the split ratio when `test_size` is a float, especially in cases of unequal group sizes.",
    "The main technical challenge lies in balancing the need to respect the number of groups (when `test_size` is an integer) and the proportion of the dataset (when `test_size` is a float). Ensuring that the split is both representative and balanced across groups with potentially varying sizes is complex. Additionally, guaranteeing that the resulting test set size aligns perfectly with the specified `test_size` can be difficult when groups contain different numbers of samples. This requires careful consideration of group boundaries and may involve trade-offs between exactness and practical usability."
