    "If there is no replacement for a broken link, contributors should add the link to the `linkcheck_ignore` variable found in the `conf.py` file of the scikit-learn documentation. This is done when links are irrecoverable, such as when the content or company no longer exists, or when the link works in a browser but is flagged as broken by the `make linkcheck` tool.",
    "Before fixing a broken link, a contributor should add a comment in the issue indicating which specific link they intend to tackle. This ensures that multiple people can work on the issue in parallel without overlapping efforts. Each contributor should then submit one Pull Request per link they fix.",
    "Mentioning the issue number #25024 in the Pull Request description helps in tracking the progress of the issue. It allows maintainers and contributors to see which links have been addressed and ensures that the work done is associated with the correct issue.",
    "The Internet Archive can be useful by providing access to old content of the broken links. Contributors can search for the broken link on the Internet Archive to view the archived version of the content, which might help them find appropriate link replacements.",
    "A link might be flagged as broken by the `make linkcheck` tool if the website is preventing bots from scraping its content. In such cases, the link might work fine when accessed directly in a browser but gets flagged during automated checks."
