  "golden_answers_generated": [
    "The current issue is that the links in the 'Pull Request Checklist' section are formatted using Markdown syntax. They need to be converted to reStructuredText (rst) format, which is the format used by Sphinx for generating the documentation.",
    "The scikit-learn documentation uses Sphinx, which is a documentation generator that utilizes reStructuredText (rst) as its markup language. Using rst ensures proper rendering of the documentation and compatibility with Sphinx features, such as cross-referencing and linking, which are not supported by Markdown.",
    "A reference to the Sphinx documentation on external links was provided: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html#external-links. This guide helps contributors understand how to format external links correctly in reStructuredText.",
    "There was a suggestion to potentially remove the instructions about type annotations, as indicated by the comment 'I'm wondering whether we shouldn't remove these instructions about type annotations.' However, the discussion concluded without a decision to remove them, and the issue was closed because it had already been addressed in a previous pull request.",
    "Contributors should check the latest documentation at https://scikit-learn.org/dev instead of the stable version at https://scikit-learn.org/stable. This ensures that they are looking at the most recent changes and updates. Additionally, when checking the code, they should ensure their local repository is up to date with the upstream master branch to avoid reporting issues that have already been resolved."
